# Housing_Prices_Kaggle
 
This is my repository where I predict housing prices with various machine learning (ML) models for continuous outcomes. The script is an example of my workflow when ingesting data, encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, preprocessing data, and fitting various models. 

After utilizing various ML models, I use the model with the highest performance to predict the test data provided by the competition to make predictions on their housing prices.
